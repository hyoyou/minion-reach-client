# Minion /REACH/

BELLOOO!! I mean.. Hello! Welcome to Minion Reach, a ~~word guessing game~~ challenging mission in which you are asked to deciper the codes set up by minions in order to save a banana farm from being consumed wholly by minions. Each mistake allows a minion to sneakily enter the farm, and the mission will be over when 6 minions are able to enter. It won't be easy! The minions have a very extensive vocabulary. Are you up for the challenge? :bowtie:

_This is a word guessing game created with React and Ruby on Rails_
