# Minion /REACH/

BELLOOO!! I mean.. Hello! Welcome to Minion Reach, a ~~word guessing game~~ challenging mission in which you are asked to deciper the codes set up by minions in order to save a banana farm from being consumed wholly by minions. Each mistake allows a minion to sneakily enter the farm, and 6 stacked minions will be able to reach a tree, in which the mission will then be over. It won't be easy! The minions have an extensive vocabulary contrary to popular belief. Are you up for the challenge?

_This is a word guessing game created with React and Ruby on Rails that I created in consideration for an apprenticeship position at LinkedIn_
